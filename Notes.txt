Notes:
1. I edit stroage Client API add some functions i don't know if it's allowed or not.
2. Broadcast has map of endpoints endpoints associated with vector of connections like the image broadcast could have multiple connections. 
3. there is a bug reciving the add-provdier which i couldn't handle it because time.
4. some of code and functions inconsistant but not that much. and some functions are left used.
5. the task mentioned that i should work on tradding-aggregator and trading-brodcaster-server only that's why i missed the symbolname implmentation. 

The starting up:
1. start all apps.
2. add-aggregator
3- add-provider.
4. subscribe to a channel it will get the data back.
5. we can push to 9000 port from "websocket client" on browser for BA.

7. BA already talks to TA
